# SQL-project---data-cleaning-

Hey! Welcome :)

In this SQL project, I have cleaned the US House selling dataset by performing the following practices:

* Standardizing the Date Format
* Populating Property Address data
* Breaking down the Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State)
* Changing "Y" and "N" to "Yes" and "No" in the "Sold as Vacant" field
* Removing duplicates
* Deleting unused columns

Feel free to check it out and provide me with your feedback.

See you!
